Getting the data

The training data set can be found on the following URL:

trainUrl <- "http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv"

The testing data set can be found on the following URL:

testUrl <- "http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv"

Procedure 1) Procedure 1) assumes that you only want to store the data files in memory.

Load data to memory solely

training <- read.csv(url(trainUrl), na.strings=c("NA","#DIV/0!",""))

testing <- read.csv(url(testUrl), na.strings=c("NA","#DIV/0!",""))

Procedure 2) Procedure 2) assumes that you want to store the data files in memory and on disk. (Thus, it involves downloading data directly to your hard drive.)

You can use following function to download the data:

getDataFiles <- function(filesDirectory = "./") { 
        if (!file.exists(filesDirectory)) {
      dir.create(filesDirectory)
           }
        testUrl <- "http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv"
        trainUrl <- "http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv"
        trainFile <- "train.csv"
        testFile <- "test.csv"
   trainFilePath <- paste(filesDirectory, trainFile, sep = "/")
        testFilePath <- paste(filesDirectory, testFile, sep = "/")
        download.file(trainUrl, destfile = trainFilePath, method="curl")
        download.file(testUrl, destfile = testFilePath, method="curl")
        training <- read.csv(trainFilePath, na.strings=c("NA","#DIV/0!",""))
        testing <- read.csv(testFilePath, na.strings=c("NA","#DIV/0!",""))
}

Run the function, for example, as follows:

getDataFiles("/data")

Note that you can simply run the function without passing any argument, which means the file will be downloaded to your current working directory. Note: To view your current working directory run the following command:

getwd()

Partioning the training set into two

Partioning Training data set into two data sets, 60% for myTraining, 40% for myTesting:

inTrain <- createDataPartition(y=training$classe, p=0.6, list=FALSE)

myTraining <- training[inTrain, ]; 

myTesting <- training[-inTrain, ]
dim(myTraining); dim(myTesting)

 [1] 11776   160
 [1] 7846  160

Cleaning the data

The following transformations were used to clean the data:

Transformation 1: Cleaning NearZeroVariance Variables Run this code to view possible NZV Variables:

myDataNZV <- nearZeroVar(myTraining, saveMetrics=TRUE)

Run this code to create another subset without NZV variables:

myNZVvars <- names(myTraining) %in% c("new_window", "kurtosis_roll_belt", "kurtosis_picth_belt",
"kurtosis_yaw_belt", "skewness_roll_belt", "skewness_roll_belt.1", "skewness_yaw_belt",
"max_yaw_belt", "min_yaw_belt", "amplitude_yaw_belt", "avg_roll_arm", "stddev_roll_arm",
"var_roll_arm", "avg_pitch_arm", "stddev_pitch_arm", "var_pitch_arm", "avg_yaw_arm",
"stddev_yaw_arm", "var_yaw_arm", "kurtosis_roll_arm", "kurtosis_picth_arm",
"kurtosis_yaw_arm", "skewness_roll_arm", "skewness_pitch_arm", "skewness_yaw_arm",
"max_roll_arm", "min_roll_arm", "min_pitch_arm", "amplitude_roll_arm", "amplitude_pitch_arm",
"kurtosis_roll_dumbbell", "kurtosis_picth_dumbbell", "kurtosis_yaw_dumbbell", "skewness_roll_dumbbell",
"skewness_pitch_dumbbell", "skewness_yaw_dumbbell", "max_yaw_dumbbell", "min_yaw_dumbbell",
"amplitude_yaw_dumbbell", "kurtosis_roll_forearm", "kurtosis_picth_forearm", "kurtosis_yaw_forearm",
"skewness_roll_forearm", "skewness_pitch_forearm", "skewness_yaw_forearm", "max_roll_forearm",
"max_yaw_forearm", "min_roll_forearm", "min_yaw_forearm", "amplitude_roll_forearm",
"amplitude_yaw_forearm", "avg_roll_forearm", "stddev_roll_forearm", "var_roll_forearm",
"avg_pitch_forearm", "stddev_pitch_forearm", "var_pitch_forearm", "avg_yaw_forearm",
"stddev_yaw_forearm", "var_yaw_forearm")

myTraining <- myTraining[!myNZVvars]
To check the new N?? of observations
dim(myTraining)

 [1] 11776   100

Transformation 2: Killing first column of Dataset - ID Removing first ID variable so that it does not interfer with ML Algorithms:

myTraining <- myTraining[c(-1)]

Transformation 3: Cleaning Variables with too many NAs. For Variables that have more than a 60% threshold of NA's I'm going to leave them out:

trainingV3 <- myTraining #creating another subset to iterate in loop
for(i in 1:length(myTraining)) { #for every column in the training dataset
        if( sum( is.na( myTraining[, i] ) ) /nrow(myTraining) >= .6 ) { #if n?? NAs > 60% of total observations
        for(j in 1:length(trainingV3)) {
            if( length( grep(names(myTraining[i]), names(trainingV3)[j]) ) ==1)  { #if the columns are the same:
                trainingV3 <- trainingV3[ , -j] #Remove that column
            }   
        } 
    }
}
To check the new N?? of observations

dim(trainingV3)

 [1] 11776    58

Seting back to our set:

myTraining <- trainingV3
rm(trainingV3)

Now let us do the exact same 3 transformations but for our myTesting and testing data sets.

clean1 <- colnames(myTraining)
clean2 <- colnames(myTraining[, -58])

already with classe column removed

myTesting <- myTesting[clean1]
testing <- testing[clean2]

To check the new N?? of observations

dim(myTesting)
 [1] 7846   58

To check the new N?? of observations

dim(testing)

 [1] 20 57
Note: The last column - problem_id - which is not equal to training sets, was also "automagically" removed
No need for this code:
testing <- testing[-length(testing)]

In order to ensure proper functioning of Decision Trees and especially RandomForest Algorithm with the Test data set (data set provided), we need to coerce the data into the same type.

for (i in 1:length(testing) ) {
        for(j in 1:length(myTraining)) {
        if( length( grep(names(myTraining[i]), names(testing)[j]) ) ==1)  {
            class(testing[j]) <- class(myTraining[i])
        }      
    }      
}
 to make sure Coertion really worked, simple smart ass technique:

testing <- rbind(myTraining[2, -58] , testing) #note row 2 does not mean anything, this will be removed right.. now:
testing <- testing[-1,]

Using ML algorithms for prediction: Decision Tree

modFitA1 <- rpart(classe ~ ., data=myTraining, method="class")

Note: to view the decision tree with fancy run this command:

fancyRpartPlot(modFitA1)

Predicting:

predictionsA1 <- predict(modFitA1, myTesting, type = "class")

(Moment of truth) Using confusion Matrix to test results:

confusionMatrix(predictionsA1, myTesting$classe)

Random Forests yielded better Results, as expected!


Generating Files to submit as answers for the Assignment:

Finally, using the provided Test Set out-of-sample error.

For Random Forests we use the following formula, which yielded a much better prediction in in-sample:

predictionsB2 <- predict(modFitB1, testing, type = "class")

Function to generate files with predictions to submit for assignment

pml_write_files = function(x){
  n = length(x)
  for(i in 1:n){
    filename = paste0("problem_id_",i,".txt")
    write.table(x[i],file=filename,quote=FALSE,row.names=FALSE,col.names=FALSE)
  }
}

pml_write_files(predictionsB2)
